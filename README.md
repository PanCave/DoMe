# Do Me!
Do Me! is a simple todo app written in flutter.

It started as a simple toy project, but might develop into something actually useful later on.

Current Features:
- Create, edit and mark todos

(Maybe) planned Features:
- Due dates
- Sorting todos by due date and done state
- Archived todos
- Calendar integration (Google, Outlook)
- what else could be interesting? Let me know!

If you have any question, feel free to reach out to me.
Have a nice day!
